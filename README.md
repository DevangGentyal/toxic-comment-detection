# 🔎 Hinglish Toxic Comment Detection

## 📌 Overview

Toxic comments on social media have become a significant issue, especially in **code-mixed languages** like **Hinglish (Hindi-English mix)**. This project introduces an **ensemble-based machine learning model** that efficiently detects toxic comments while being computationally optimized compared to transformer-based approaches.

## 🛠️ Model Architecture

The proposed model is an **ensemble of three traditional machine learning classifiers**:

1. **Logistic Regression (LR)**
2. **Random Forest (RF)**
3. **Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)**

The final predictions are obtained using a **Soft Voting Classifier**, which averages the probabilities from all three models to enhance robustness and generalization. The dataset was preprocessed using **TF-IDF with character-level n-grams (1 to 6)** to capture **transliterations and variations** commonly found in Hinglish text. Additionally, **Random Oversampling** was applied to handle class imbalance and improve the model's ability to correctly classify toxic comments.

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained and evaluated on the **Multilingual-Abusive-Comment-Detection (nsfw\_train)** dataset, which contains labeled **toxic and non-toxic Hinglish comments**.

- **Preprocessing Techniques Used:**
  - Removal of **special characters, hashtags, URLs, and mentions**
  - Text normalization and **tokenization**
  - Handling **class imbalance** using **Random Oversampling**
  - Feature extraction using **TF-IDF with character-level n-grams (1 to 6)**
